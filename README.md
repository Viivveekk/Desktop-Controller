We designed and implemented finger tracking based on a virtual mouse application using a regular webcam. Furthermore, we integrated a speech-to-text converter. While touchscreen technology is popular in mobile devices, it is costly for desktop systems. Therefore, we explored computer vision techniques as an alternative method to create a virtual human-computer interaction device, such as a mouse using a webcam and voice commands using a mic.

For better Working Create an Virtual Environment.
1. Navigate to Your Project Directory:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```
2. Create a Virtual Environment:

   You can use the venv module that comes with Python:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the Virtual Environment:
   
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install Requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```

5. Run the main.py file:
